App Structure & Navigation
This defines the "rooms" of your app and how you move between them. We'll use a Bottom Tab Bar for primary navigation (as you suggested) and a Hamburger/Sidebar for secondary items.

1. Primary Navigation (Bottom Tab Bar)
This is the fastest way to get to the 3 main "zones" of the app. It's a classic PWA pattern.

[Tab 1] Home (Icon: Sprout)

Purpose: The "Present." What you're doing right now.

Content:

Main Visual: Your plant's progress (e.g., "Day 5: Your sprout is growing!").

Primary CTA: A large button: "Start Daily Reflection" (This kicks off the core loop: triage questions -> meditation guide -> post-reflection).

Secondary CTA: A smaller button or link: "Log a Quick Thought" (Opens a simple modal: "What's on your mind?" + text box).

"On This Day" Module: A card showing your entry from 1, 2, or X years ago.

"Today's Question" Module: A small card with a single, simple prompt ("What made you smile today?").

[Tab 2] Journal (Icon: Book)

Purpose: The "Past." Reviewing all your old entries.

Content:

Controls: A search bar and a calendar icon (to jump to a specific date).

View: A reverse-chronological list of your entries, grouped by day.

Entry Card: Shows the date, the primary mood (emoji), and a snippet of the text. Tapping it opens the full entry, including any photos you uploaded.

[Tab 3] Future (Icon: Time Capsule/Sealed Letter)

Purpose: The "Future." Planning and anticipating.

Content (This is V2, but we'll build the space for it):

"Time Capsule" Feature:

Button: "Ask Future You a Question."

A list of your "Sealed Messages" (e.g., "Opens in 6 months").

A list of "Delivered Messages" you can re-read.

"Scheduled Reflections" Feature:

"Schedule a check-in about 'My Job' every Friday."

2. Secondary Navigation (Header + Hamburger Menu)
Header:

Left: Hamburger Menu Icon (to open the sidebar).

Center: "Project Reflect" (or the name of the current tab).

Sidebar (Opens from Hamburger):

"Your Full Garden": A link to a "trophy case" page showing all your fully-grown, flowered plants.

"Profile": Your name, email, etc.

"Settings":

Notification preferences (timing for quick check-ins, daily reflection).

Data Export ("Download all my entries").

Account (Change password, Delete account).

"Logout"
