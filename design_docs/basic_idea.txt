📝 Project: Reflect (Design Document V1)
This document outlines the vision, features, and core user flow for a personal mindfulness PWA. We can workshop the artisanal name later.

1. Project Vision & Goal
To create a personal refuge on your phone, not another chore. It's a mindfulness tool designed to replace aimless social media scrolling with structured, valuable reflection. The primary user (User Zero) is you. Success is defined by your consistent, personal use.

2. Core Philosophy
Personal First: The app must be 100% functional and valuable for a single user.

Gentle Engagement: No high-pressure, "Duolingo-owl-of-death" streaks. The gamification (the plant) is about nurturing, not punishing.

Tangible Reflection: Encourage real-world actions (physical drawing) and tangible insights (data you can use).

3. Tech Stack (As Defined)
Frontend: React (with Vite)

PWA (Progressive Web App): For home-screen install and notifications.

Backend: Firebase

Firestore: Database for entries, moods, user settings.

Firebase Auth: User login.

Firebase Storage: To store user-uploaded photos (of their drawings/journals).

🚀 Core Features (MVP)
This is the focused V1. We'll build just enough to make it your go-to app.

1. The "Quick Check-in"
Trigger: An interactive PWA notification (e.g., 3 times a day).

UI: "How are you feeling right now?" with 5 emoji options (e.g., 😫, 😕, 😐, 🙂, 😄).

Action: User taps an emoji in the notification.

Result: The mood is logged with a timestamp. This single tap counts as "watering" the plant. It's the lowest-friction engagement possible.

2. The "Daily Reflection" (The Core Loop)
This is the main, scheduled "session" (e.g., at 9 PM).

Step 1: The Triage

The app opens and asks 2-3 simple questions to set the context:

"What's the loudest thought in your mind?" (Text input)

"Where in your body do you feel it?" (e.g., Tense Shoulders, Jittery Stomach, Calm Chest)

Step 2: The Suggested Meditation

Based on the answers (e.g., "loud thought" + "tense shoulders"), the app suggests a 5-minute, text-based meditation.

Example: "It sounds like your mind is busy. Let's try a 5-minute 'Body Scan' meditation to ground you."

Step 3: The Timer & Guide

The meditation screen will show:

Text Instructions: Simple, clear steps. ("Find a quiet seat. Close your eyes. We'll start with 10 deep breaths...")

Breathing Visual: A simple, animated circle that expands and contracts to guide breathing patterns (e.g., "In... Out...").

Timer: A 5-minute countdown.

Audio Cue: A local audio file (a simple ding.mp3 bundled with the app) that chimes at the beginning and end. No streaming, no hosting.

Step 4: The Post-Reflection

Immediately after the timer, the app prompts with questions specific to the meditation:

(After 'Body Scan'): "What sensation did you notice that you weren't aware of before?"

(After 'Breathing'): "Did you find your mind wandering? What did it wander to?"

Step 5: The Physical Capture (Optional)

A simple prompt: "Did you write or draw anything you want to save?"

A [Take Photo] button that opens the phone's native camera.

The photo is uploaded to Firebase Storage and linked to the journal entry.

3. The Garden (Gamification)
Core Idea: You nurture a virtual plant, which represents your mindfulness practice.

Flow:

You start with a Seed.

Each check-in or reflection "waters" it, increasing a growth counter (e.g., growth_points: 7).

The UI shows the plant visually changing: Seed -> Sprout -> Growing -> Flowered.

Reward: Once it "flowers" (e.g., at 30 points), it moves to your permanent "Garden" (a trophy case).

You are given a new seed of a different variety. This encourages long-term collection.

4. "On This Day" (The Hook)
The app's home screen will have one primary module: "On This Day."

It checks Firestore for any entries with createdAt timestamps matching today's month/day from previous years.

Example: "One year ago today, you were feeling 😕 and reflected on your job..."

This provides immediate, compounding value and is a massive driver for long-term use.

🔮 V2 & Future Ideas (The Parking Lot)
This is the stuff we won't build for the MVP, but will keep in mind.

"Ask Future You" Time Capsule: The feature to write a message/question to be opened in 6 months, 1 year, etc.

Graphs & Insights: The "Dashboard" page showing mood graphs over time and correlating moods with journal topics (e.g., "You've mentioned 'Work' on 80% of the days you felt 'Stressed'").

The Social Layer (V-Future): The optional ability to share specific entries or check-ins with a partner or trusted friend. (Your "anti-social media" social feature).
