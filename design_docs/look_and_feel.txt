🎨 Look & Feel: "Calm & Nurturing"

Content Backgrounds: bg-white or bg-peach-100 (For cards, text boxes).
Primary Interactive: bg-purple-600 (The "main" button color, like "Start Reflection"). 
Dark, rich, but inviting.Secondary Interactive: bg-mauve-400 (For less important buttons 
or highlights).Accent/Highlight: bg-peach-400 (For icons or active states).

choice. It's rounded, friendly, and highly legible. It feels modern and gentle, not 
"threatening" or corporate.Headings (e.g., "Your Daily Reflection"): font-nunito text-2xl
 font-bold text-purple-900Body Text: font-nunito text-lg text-purple-800 (Note: We'll 
 use text-lg as the default for an easy-to-read, mobile-first experience).3. Verbiage 
 (The Voice)This is critical for the "mindful" feel. The app is your gentle guide, not 
 a drill sergeant.Instead of...We'll use..."New Entry""A new reflection" or "What's on 
 your mind?""Submit""Save my thought" or "I'm done""Streak""Your garden's growth"
 "Dashboard""Home" or "Your Garden""Error""A small hiccup. Let's try that again gently."
 "Prompt""An idea for you..." or "A gentle question..."4. Components (Tailwind)Buttons:
